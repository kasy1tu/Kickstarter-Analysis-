1. Given the provided data, what are three conclusions we can draw about Kickstarter campaigns?

First conclusion: Using the Pivot Table filtered by category, we can conclude that ‘Music’ has the highest percentage of successful campaigns (77.14% successful). If we only looked at the Pivot Chart line graph, the information may be misleading because the category ‘Theater’ seems to be higher than the rest of the categories. However, it is the second high percentage of successful campaigns (60.23%). 
Second conclusion: The countries US and GB has the most number of campaigns - 3038 and 604 campaigns respectively. Although US has more campaigns, only 50.34% of them are successful while 60.60% of GB’s campaign are successful. 
Third conclusion: The sub-category ‘plays’ is very popular - it makes up 25.91% of the entire list of sub-category.

2. What are some limitations of this dataset?

In my opinion, one of the limitations of this dataset is that we’re not able to identify the factors that help a campaign be successful since there are subjective data (e.g. blurb). It would be helpful to understand the backers’ perspective - what criteria were they looking for in order to decide if they would back the campaign? 

In addition, I think it would be interesting to analyze what the average goal is per category and/or subcategory. That way, we can also determine if a certain category/subcategory’s goal was set too high (therefore resulting in a ‘Failed’ state). In reverse, we would also be able to identify whether or not a campaign succeeded because their goal was lower than average. 

3. What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create? 

We could also create graphs that visualizes the columns Staff Pick, Backers Count, and Spotlight in order to determine if there’s a relationship between them. I think it would be interesting to see if the total number of Backers Count correlates with Staff Pick = true and/or Spotlight = true; the idea is that if a campaign had an above average Backers Count, then it would be more likely to be true for Spotlight and Staff Pick.
